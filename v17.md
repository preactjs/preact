# Breaking changes

- The package now only exports ESM https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3552
- `GraphQLError` can now only be constructed with a message and options rather than also with positional arguments https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3577
- `createSourceEventStream` can now only be used with with an object-argument rather than alsow with positional arguments https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3635
- Allow `subscribe` to return a value rather than only a Promise, this makes the returned type in line with `execute` https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3620
- `execute` throws an error when it sees a `@defer` or `@stream` directive, use `experimentalExecuteIncrementally` instead https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3722
- Remove support for defer/stream from subscriptions, in case you have fragments that you use with `defer/stream` that end up in a subscription, use the `if` argument of the directive to disable it in your subscriptin operations https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3742
