  HTM (Hyperscript Tagged Markup)
</h1>

## Sleeknote fork of [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm)

The purpose of this fork is to support [hyperHTML](https://viperhtml.js.org/hyperhtml/documentation/) flavored template literals out of the box, 
without any modifications to the original code. Only features we have used so far are supported

- supports [data attribute](https://viperhtml.js.org/hyperhtml/documentation/#essentials-6-2)
- supports Sleeknote defined extensions: all-attributes (text property in all-attributes), raw-text, raw-html
