# Tests skipped to get CI to pass

- Fragment
  - ✖ should not preserve state between array nested in fragment and double nested array
  - ✖ should preserve state between double nested fragment and double nested array
- hydrate
  - ✖ should override incorrect pre-existing DOM with VNodes passed into render

Also:

- Extend Fragment preserving state tests to track unmounting lifecycle callbacks to verify
  components are properly unmounted. I think all 'should not preserve' tests are the ones
  that will have unmount operations.
