name: Benchmark Worker

# Expectations:
#
# This workflow expects calling workflows to have uploaded an artifact named
# "bench-environment" that contains any built artifacts required to run the
# benchmark. This typically is the dist/ folder that running `npm run build`
# produces and/or a tarball of a previous build to bench the local build against
